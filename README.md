# Game-Libraries
Program that allows users to view and play games from their combined Steam and GOG Galaxy libraries. Note that this is for Windows only, and that the visible games are only those installed on users' machines (not games that are in users' libraries but not yet installed).

The main directory's game_libraries.py contains source code, and the dist directory contains the program in .exe form (created using py2exe).
